# Sentiment Analysis Program README

## Overview

This Sentiment Analysis Program is designed to classify text files containing reviews into positive or negative categories. It utilizes a Bag-of-Words (BoW) model for feature extraction and applies a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm for classification. Additionally, it includes a sentimental analysis component that calculates a sentiment score based on predefined word strengths.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## Installation

Ensure that Python and NumPy are installed on your system. You can install NumPy using pip if it is not already installed:

```
pip install numpy
```

## Program Structure

The program consists of several modules:

1. **`read_files_from_folder`**: Reads all text files in a specified folder and returns their paths.

2. **`build_voc`**: Builds a vocabulary from the text files in a given folder, excluding specified stopwords.

3. **`bow_feature_extraction`**: Extracts Bag-of-Words features from text files using the vocabulary generated by `build_voc`.

4. **`knn_classification`**: Performs k-Nearest Neighbors classification on the extracted features.

5. **`build_sentimental_dict`**: Builds a dictionary mapping words to their sentiment strength from a provided file.

6. **`sentimentalAnalysis`**: Calculates the sentiment score of text files based on the sentiment strength dictionary.

## Usage

1. **Preparing Data**:
   - Organize your positive and negative review text files into two separate folders.
   - Prepare a text file containing words and their sentiment strengths, formatted as: `word strength` (one pair per line).

2. **Running the Program**:
   - Update the paths in the `main` function to your data folders and word strength file.
   - Run the program. It will build the vocabulary, extract features, classify the reviews, and print the classification accuracy.
   - The sentiment analysis part will print the sentiment scores for each file.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that your text files are encoded in UTF-8 to avoid encoding errors.
- The program is set up to use cosine distance for kNN classification, but this can be changed by modifying the `DistType` variable in the `main` function.
- The `K` variable in the `main` function determines the number of neighbors to consider in kNN classification. Adjust this based on your dataset for optimal results.
- The sentiment analysis component is separate from the kNN classification and provides an additional metric for evaluating text sentiment.

## Customization

- You can customize the list of stopwords in the `main` function as needed.
- The `words_strength_path` variable in the sentiment analysis section should be updated to the path of your word strength file.
