I have been a fan of Google for many years.  Their philanthropic practices do a lot to improve humanity.  They always put forth significant time and effort to create new products which they then make available to the public for free, simply for the sake of making the world a better place.  Google Goggles is one such app.  With it, I can take a picture of anything in the world with my phone and the app will do a web search and return any relevant information about it's theoretically.  In practice however, the app has many problems.  The built in optical character recognition software has trouble converting many fonts into text.  Since this text is the basis for many of its searches, an incorrectly read word can lead to nonsensical results.  If the photo has no words, I believe it is compared to a database of famous landmarks next.  Finally, as a last resort, it seems to match equivalent colors and return a list of pictures that appear visually similar.  Understandably, this last (and most useless) category is unfortunately the most common, making the app largely worthless.  It does have one interesting feature: in a collaboration with The Metropolitan Museum of Art, each painting has its own webpage detailing its history; this information is retrieved when you point the app at anything in the entire gallery, acting as your own personal tour guide.  While this is a brilliant idea, for those of us who don't live in New York, it is inconsequential.  This app has such lofty goals and immense potential, but until the image recognition system is perfected, it will remain a source of frustration and disappointment.
