This is a media player that is usually the default media software for most Microsoft Windows operating system. In my experience, it doesn't play certain file times. In other words the file type supported aren't as big as other open source software in my experience. This has been my experience with audio and video files. Also, the program is very clunky and seems to take up a lot of memory. I like to edit the file names of my music and there are usually many songs. I've also had trouble editing the file tags of songs, usually the changes I made don't permanently change the tags of the file. So it creates some frustration moving the audio files to a new device that doesn't use windows media player.
