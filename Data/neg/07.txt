Facebook is an app that allows you to see your Facebook account and to help you indulge in your social media desires. However, in my opinion, the app that is made by Facebook, a multi-billion dollar company, has a plethora of issues that plague its existence. This app has had so many issues, but it is still one of the most downloaded apps of all time simply because there really is no alternative besides viewing your Facebook through a browser (which is what I do). Reports have shown that the app is a huge battery hog and is of course recording everything that you do. Google something that interests you? You now have ads on your Facebook page about said interests. Use Facebook messenger to chat to your friend about a movie? You know have ads about said movie on your Facebook page. It's listening to everything you do. Also, how silly is it that Facebook is actually split into two different apps? One for the statuses and other social media features, and the other is Facebook messenger where you can chat with your friends on Facebook. Why does it have to be separated and not just a single app?
