I belive that this game is the sole reason that I am slowly starting to lose faith in humanity. I know many people who have delved quite deep into this 
terrible abomination, and have spent many of hundreds of dollars crawling through it. While the game is excellent within the bounds of Human Computer
Interaction, I still think there is a much better use of time for any individual playing it.
