I think preview is a terrible app because it has a lot of multimedia 
    functionality, however it is not very intuitive to use.  Adding something like 
    an electronic signature is difficult to do because it requires toggling into a 
    different toolbar.  Adding something like a textbox is equally difficult.  This 
    application is mainly meant to view and markup pictures/PDFs, but it almost 
    entirely focuses on the viewing of pictures.  The app effectively makes the 
    program a single media application, when it holds more functionality.  
    Additionally, the markup can often look somewhat childish.  If I want to look at,
    fill out, and sign an official document, I am reluctant to do this on preview 
    because it will not look professional.  This really seems to go against the 
    intent of the app, it essentially makes me want to just use adobe acrobat.  At 
    the same time, preview feels a bit unprofessional, but it doesnâ€™t allow for some 
    of the fun manipulations that Microsoft Paint would allow.  So I have an app 
    that has some characteristics of a professional app, and some of a fun markup app,
    but I am left with the worst of both worlds.  This ultimately castrates the 
    multimedia app, limiting it to an image viewing app.
