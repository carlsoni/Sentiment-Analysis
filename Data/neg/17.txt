As the world’s largest social media network, Facebook is marketed as a way to connect friends around the world. In reality, Facebook is a massive waste of time. The majority of media a user sees on the site is unrelated to their friends’ activity, and is generally content that friends have “liked” or commented on. On mobile, advertiesments are overwhelming, and come in obnoxious forms such as automatically playing videos. For content that actually is produced by friends, it is generally a highlight reel, which can have the effect of making the user feel less positive about their own life. The majority of friends a user has generally aren’t even close. The average user has hundreds of “friends” on the site, and scrolling through their posts just adds to the amount of dull content a user sees. Facebook is invasive to privacy: any user can be searched and found by anyone around the globe. While users can alter some settings and can share most information/content to friends only, the defaults are set so that a user’s information is very open. All likes, posts, and posted information can be combined to form a highly targeted profile for advertisement, potentially turning the experience of browsing Facebook into a costly one.
