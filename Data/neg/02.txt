It is really slow and there is a lot of lag generally. However, I think in general most video chatting apps are pretty horrible because we really haven’t improved that area of technology that much. I think all sorts of video chatting apps could be improved with less delays and better image quality.  Sometimes the sound is also delayed when people are talking. Also it takes a lot of power out of your device. Sometimes i’ve encountered problems where my mic is turned on but for some reason the other person can still not hear me and vice versa.
