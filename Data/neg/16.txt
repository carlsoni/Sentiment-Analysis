In my view, Facebook has become inundated with memes and political rants.  Once, Facebook was a fairly good app that allowed people to connect and share pictures, music, and other forms of multimedia.  However, as Facebook has grown in popularity, more and more of the content it finds to be relevant to me is very bad. Facebook attempts to link me to people that I don’t know or that I had forgotten about (that i don’t want to remember).  Also, Facebook can be a very big waste of time.  Due to the algorithms that determine things I may be interested, I find myself clicking on useless info for far too long.
