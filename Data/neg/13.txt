The reason why Maps is not good is sometimes when I driving on some heavy traffic roads, suddenly the APP is stop working and back to the home page with no reason. Because I'm driving at that time and have no idea where I should go. Sometimes I need to pull over at the side of road and reopen it which is really sucks. Finally I changed to use Google maps and it is much better.
