Baidu is evil, so is its application. Baidu Yun will change your personal data without your permission. Some of your videos will be turned into 8 seconds short videos which indicate that they have been censored. And the sensor is not always correct, which means your personal, legal videos will be censored too. It’s gone. Besides, some presses have reported that Baidu Yun leaks some users' personal photos which can be searched by Baidu search engine. Any one of these behaviors show that this company cannot be trusted. No one would like to pose his personal information into risks.At least, I am very distrust this company and recommend my friend to use other application to replace Baidu’s.
Apart from these problems, the product itself also terrible. You cannot create a download link in mobile app, if you want, you have to go to the webpage. What’s more, there is only two resolutions of video you can choose, original and fluid. However, other application like 115 can choose various resolution from HD to original and support create magnet link and BT download inside the app. The most important thing is that the speed of streaming of video is slow. In conclusion, above reasons explained why Baidu Yun is the worst app in my personal point of view.
