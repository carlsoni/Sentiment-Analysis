The worst multimedia application is the City of Tempe website. I feel that this website is one of the worst applications because of the day and age that we live in. First, there is no online help or automated system to help with simple questions when no one is working. The hours to contact them are from 9am to 5pm, which are normal, working hours when everyone is busy, so not having the option for online help is a challenge that should not exist with the technology available. Next, setting up an account or adding a service to an account must be done in person or over the phone.  Both of the tasks above could and should be done easily online through an automated system. The combination of hours and limited online help drives the user satisfaction rating of the website down. To summarize, I feel that this website along with any other website that does not take advantage of the technology that is available to make the user and the employees job easier is a poor designed and underdeveloped website. The website has the potential to be fast and efficient if it chose to adopt the technology available. This is why I feel the City of Tempe website is one of the worst examples of a multimedia application.
