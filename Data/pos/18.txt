The reason why I choose it is that it satisfies my needs well. Unlike traditional online courses, you can interact with the course staff and learn by doing. I need to submit the homeworks in order to pass the course. And I will get my scores graded by autograder or do peer assignment and has some feedback. You would not use a app unless you have needs. In addition, It has some features which other competitors do not have. First, it is cross platform, it offers web application, iOS and Android versions. The point is it has iPad version, which edx do not have. So I can watch video on a lager screen than on small phone screen. Second, I can access to discussion forum in the app and I can see the post conveniently (Udacity do not have). This feature saves my time to switch applications between web page and iPad app.
At least but not last, it provides more than 1500 courses which is highest among the massive open online course (MOOCs) platform. Personally speaking, although the quality of some courses are not as good as before, it still my favorite multimedia app.
