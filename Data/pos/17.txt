Google provides a wide range of multimedia services using the latest technologies. The search engine itself indexes trillions of pages and manages to provide the most relevant possible results to most queries. Every year, the search engine becomes better at understanding what the user is looking for. Instead of requiring search queries that are specifically formed to be clearly understood, searches in natural and casual language provide very relevant results. Other Google functionalities are integrated directly with the search engine, such as language translation, a calculator, timezone conversion, and unit conversion. With Google, users can search any form of media available on the web. Google Images instantly retrieves thousands of results for any search, and even provides “reverse image searching” to find similar images and link to any webpages which use them. Youtube hosts countless hours of video on all subjects imagineable. All of this functionality is incredibly fast due to massive engineering efforts by Google: indexing, caching, and use of highly parallel processing. While Google’s main source of income is advertisement, the actual ads on Google search results are minimal and uninvasive, compared to how advertisement is handled on other sites, which keeps the user experience on Google positive.
