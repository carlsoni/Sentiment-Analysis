I enjoy listening to Pandora while I walk to class, am at the gym, or am doing homework.  I really enjoy the features of Pandora. For example, the ability to find a custom station based on a single song or an artist.  In this way, I have found numerous bands that I like that I would have not otherwise known about. When I choose a station, Pandora utilizes some form of artificial intelligence to determine other songs/ artists that I may be interested in.
