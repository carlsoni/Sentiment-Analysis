My favorite multimedia application is Netflix for a variety of reasons. First, Netflix provides an easy and simple way to have access to thousands of movies and shows.  Second, Netflix is consistently available with a reasonable network connection.  Netflix consistently provides new material for different viewing preferences.  The overall quality is great and there are consistent updates to fix any kinds of bugs, issues, or any other problems that may occur.  The human and computer interaction is a very easy and simple to use system that causes little confusion i.e. pause and play. Netflix makes the choice of paying a monthly fee an easy one because of how accessible they make their content.  From a technical standpoint the ability to stream to millions of people at all times with very little issue is a key feature. The GUI interface is well designed for each platform that Netflix is available on. The latency of starting a movie or show is extremely low because of their ability to load content in a fast and accurate manor. Netflix is my favorite multimedia app because it causes very little effort from a user side to enjoy all the perks of the application on multiple platforms.
