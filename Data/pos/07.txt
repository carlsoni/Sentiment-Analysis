Mint is an amazing and simple app with many features to help me keep track of my expenditures. Since I work part-time right now, I do not have much money while still renting an apartment. Mint helps me keep track of where my money is going and how I can best manage it. It also allows me to set budgets on certain categories per month like how much money I wish to use on entertainment, and it will alert me if I went over on the self-allowed budget. It works by you inputting your account credentials of your bank accounts. Interestingly, it used to work this why by page-scanning the webpage where it shows your transactions and inputting the amounts into its own database as some banks did not let them use their APIs or the banks had none. Now, I beleive that is fixed as they can now use the APIs. Mint also has other cool features like being able to check your creit score if you wish to provide your social. Further, it has a helpful tab which advises you on your spending habits and how to better yourself with them (although usually it's advertisements of getting certain credit cards).
