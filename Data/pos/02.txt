I like Snapchat because it is easy and fun to use. It has a simple user interface and you can send videos, or images to your friends. I really like all the stickers that theyâ€™ve incorporated into the app.  I think the product overall is very great and I like that they have been growing and expanding and adding various news/ channels into the app so that you can watch more than just what your friends post. I like using snapchat because it is a more entertaining way to chat with friends. It is also very creative, and people can make funny videos or pictures and send them to friends. The app is very interactive and there are so many different filters to try and play with.
