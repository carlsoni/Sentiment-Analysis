It's a website and also mobile application where users can either upload audio file or listen to audio files. It mostly contains music from artists that don't have a large following. The app is easy to use and also the sound is played back in a good quality even though the user is traveling and using a mobile network. I get to follow my favorite artists and DJs and listen to their newest tracks and also mixes. Also, I can message the artist and ask for the tracks used in a mix if it wasnâ€™t posted on the mix. I believe this app relates to this course because it has to access files on a database and play it back without having to download the whole file first like most online applications using audio files. One of the drawbacks of the application is that it doesnt have an option to increase the sound quality, but the current solution could be a happy medium between sound quality and download limitations of WiFi or mobile networks.
