Wechat is the APP people used to send texts and voice messages in China. It is really convenient and efficient to communicate with friends and family members. People can send pictures, voice messages, texts to others just by pressing a button which likes the iMessages. Also, they can share their funny moments by this APP in a function called "Friends Circle ", which is something like Facebook. Overall, Wechat is a great APP for me.
