I love being to interact on such a large scale. The ability to peer into everyone's lives without the bother of gossiping has lowered my productivity
quite heavily, but gives me much pride to see how much better I am doing then my high school bullies. On a more serious note, being able to connect with 
my family who live all over the country in such an easy manner is my favorite part of Facebook.
